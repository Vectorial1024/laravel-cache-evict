Efficiently remove expired cache data in Laravel.

## Situation
As of writing, several Laravel cache drivers do not have automatic removal of expired cached items:

- `file`
- `database`

### Why is it a problem?
Using any of the above cache drivers without regularly removing the expired items (aka "key eviction" in Redis) can result in storage overload, especially when you are creating a lot of temporary items with random keys.

The `cache:clear` command from Laravel works, but might not be the thing you want. It does not check item expiry (it removes everything), and also removes cached Laravel facades in `/storage/framework/cache/`, which can be especially problematic when you are using the `file` cache driver (consider a case: cache items are created by the `www-data` user but `/storage/framework/cache/*` is owned by the `ubuntu` user).

In this case, this tool can help you remove only the expired items in your cache. See below sections for more details.

This tool is designed to be memory efficient and (for `database` caches) non-blocking, so even if there are a lot of items in the cache (e.g. you are running this for the first time to deal with an oversized cache), it can still run reasonably well.

## Install
via Composer:

```sh
composer require vectorial1024/laravel-cache-evict
```

Suggestions:
- (Optional) `ext-intl` allows using Laravel's own `Number::fileSize()` for size reporting

### Supported cache types
The following cache drivers from `cache.php` are currently supported:
- `database`
- `file`

Some drivers (e.g. `memcached`, `redis`) will never be supported because they have their own item eviction mechanisms; use those features instead of this tool!

Custom eviction strategies can be defined for other cache drivers that does not have their own eviction mechanisms (see FAQ section).

### Change log
Please see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Usage

You may run this in the command line:

```sh
# evicts the default cache in your Laravel app
php artisan cache:evict

# you may also specify the cache to clear; e.g. the file cache defined in cache.php:
php artisan cache:evict file
```

Or, you may put this into your console kernel schedule:

```php
use Vectorial1024\LaravelCacheEvict\CacheEvictCommand;

// note: because this command may have long running time, it is strongly recommended to run this command in the background
// this avoids accidentally delaying other scheduled tasks

// evicts the default cache in your Laravel app
Schedule::command(CacheEvictCommand::class)->daily()->runInBackground();

// you may also specify the cache to clear; e.g. the file cache defined in cache.php:
Schedule::command(CacheEvictCommand::class, ['file'])->daily()->runInBackground();
```

### The relationship with `cache.php`
This tool checks the cache *name* (not *driver*!) inside `cache.php` to determine which cache to clear. This means, if you have the following `cache.php` ...

```php
[
    'stores' => [
        'local_store' => [
            'driver' => 'file',
            // other config...
        ],

        'another_store' => [
            'driver' => 'file',
            // other config...
        ],
    ],
]
```

... and you run the command like this ...

```sh
php artisan cache:evict local_store
```

... then, you will only evict the `local_store` cache. The `another_store` cache is unaffected by this command (assuming both are using separate directories, of course).

## Testing
PHPUnit (using `orchestra/testbench`) via Composer:

```sh
composer run-script test
```

## Frequently-asked questions (FAQ)

### How to define custom eviction strategies?
You can do so inside your Laravel service provider. Simply do the following:

```php
public function boot()
{
    // register a handler for a specific cache driver
    // YourEvictStrategy extends Vectorial1024\LaravelCacheEvict\AbstractEvictStrategy
    CacheEvictStrategies::registerDriverStrategy('your_driver_name', YourEvictStrategy::class);

    // or, register that a specific cache driver should not be handled because it has its own handler already
    CacheEvictStrategies::registerDriverRefusedBecauseFeatureExists('self_managed_driver_name');
}
```

### Will this tool help me reclaim `database` disk spaces?
No, but if you are using this tool regularly to evict expired items, then you usually do not need to worry about reclaiming those disk spaces. For more details, talk with a system admin/database specialist.

### Can I run this tool during high-traffic hours?
Sure! This tool is designed with high-traffic situations in mind. It is memory-efficient and (for `database` caches) non-blocking.
Feel free to run this tool e.g. hourly.
